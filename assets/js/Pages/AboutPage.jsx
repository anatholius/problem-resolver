            <BlockTitle>How to solve the problem?</BlockTitle>
            <p>To be able to think about solving a problem, you must be aware of the fundamental importance of the
                problem.</p>
            <p>Much work in solving a problem is to understand the essence of the problem. Instead of focusing on
                symptoms, look for the source of the problem. If the problem has a cause and the cause can be
                eliminated, the problem is solved.</p>
            <h5>To successfully solve problems, you need key skills such as:</h5>

                                Problems are usually resolved intuitively or systematically. Intuition is used when no
                                new knowledge is needed, i.e. you know enough to be able to make a quick decision and
                                solve a problem, or you use common sense or experience to solve a problem. Very complex
                                problems or problems you have never experienced before will probably require a more
                                systematic and logical approach to solve them, and for this you will need creative
                                thinking.

                                (Search / research skills) - Defining and solving problems often requires some research:
                                it can be a simple Google search engine or a more rigorous research project.

                                Many problems can be defined and solved thanks to the contribution of others. Teamwork
                                does not necessarily have to be about professional work, but it is equally important at
                                home, in the school, or in the company of friends.

                                It is worth considering the impact that the problem and / or its solution has on you and
                                other people. Emotional intelligence, the ability to recognize emotions in yourself and
                                others, will help you find the right solution

            <BlockTitle bold>What is the problem</BlockTitle>
            The Concise Oxford Dictionary (1995) defines it as:
            <blockquote>A doubtful or difficult matter that needs to be resolved</blockquote>
            and
            <blockquote>Something difficult to understand, achieve or solve</blockquote>
            <b>It is also worth considering our own view of the problem</b>
            <p>We are constantly exposed to opportunities in life, at work, at school and at home. However, many
                opportunities are lost or are not fully exploited. We are often not sure how to take advantage of this
                opportunity and create barriers, the reasons why we cannot take advantage of it. These barriers can
                transform a potentially positive situation into a negative one - a problem.</p>
            <p>Are we missing a big problem? It is human nature to notice and focus on small, easy-to-solve problems,
                but it is much harder to work on large problems that can cause some of the smaller ones.</p>
            <p>When dealing with a potential problem, consider the following questions:</p>
            <p>Is the problem a real problem or is it just how we perceive it</p>
            <p>Is this problem a chance?</p>
            <p>Does the problem need a solution?</p>
        </Block>
        <Block strong>
            <BlockTitle bold><b>All problems have two common features: goals and barriers</b></BlockTitle>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <b>Problems include actions to achieve a certain objective or desired state of affairs and may include
                avoiding a situation or event</b>
            <p>Goals can be anything you want to achieve or where you want to be. If you're hungry, your goal is
                probably to eat something. If you are an entrepreneur, your main goal is to make a profit from revenues,
                and this main goal may need to be divided into many sub-goals to achieve the ultimate goal of obtaining
                these profits.</p>
            <h3>Barriers</h3>
            <b>If there were no barriers to achieving the goal, there would be no problems. Problem solving is about
                overcoming barriers or obstacles that prevent you from reaching your goal immediately.</b>
            <p>According to our examples above, if you feel hungry your goal is food. The lack of food may be a barrier
                to this. So you should go to the store and buy food, removing the barrier and solving this problem.
                There may be many more barriers for entrepreneurs, so try to recognize them and remove or find other
                ways to achieve your business goals.</p>
        </Block>
        <Block>
            <p>Trying to solve a complex problem may be a mistake. An old adage says "a common problem is a halved
                problem." So sharing a problem with someone else can be a good way to get closer to it.</p>

            <h2>Stages of problem solving</h2>
            <b>Successful troubleshooting usually involves a series of steps or steps, such as those described
                below.</b>
            <h3>1. Problem identification</h3>
            <b>This stage includes: detection and diagnosis of the problem; determining the nature of the problem;
                problem definition</b>
            <p>The first phase of problem solving may seem obvious, but often requires more reflection and analysis.
                Identifying the problem alone can be a difficult task. Is this a problem at all? What is the nature of
                the problem, are there really many problems? What is the best way to define a problem? By spending some
                time defining a problem, you will not only understand it better, but you will be able to convey its
                nature to others, which leads to the second phase.</p>
            <h3>2. Problem structure</h3>
            <b>This stage includes: observation period, careful control, establishing facts and developing a clear
                picture of the problem</b>
            <p>After identifying the problem, structuring it involves obtaining additional information about the problem
                and increasing understanding. In this phase, it's about establishing facts and analyzing, building a
                more comprehensive picture of both the goal (s) and the barrier (barriers). This stage may not be
                necessary for very simple problems, but is necessary for problems of a more complex nature</p>
            <h3>3. Searching for possible solutions</h3>
            <b>At this stage, you will generate a number of possible courses of action, but with little attempt to
                evaluate them at this stage</b>
            <p>Based on the information gathered in the first two phases of the problem solving structure, it's time to
                start thinking about possible solutions to the identified problem. In a group situation, this stage is
                often carried out as a brainstorming process, allowing each person in the group to express their views
                on possible solutions (or partial solutions). In organizations, different people will have different
                expertise in different areas, and it is therefore useful to hear the views of each stakeholder</p>
            <h3>4. Decision making</h3>
            <b>This stage involves analyzing various possible directions of action and then selecting the best solution
                to implement</b>
            <p>This is perhaps the most complex part of the problem solving process. Continuing the previous step, it's
                time to look at each potential solution and thoroughly analyze it. Some solutions may not be possible
                due to other problems, such as time limits or budgets. At this stage, it is also important to think
                about what can happen if nothing is done to solve the problem - sometimes trying to solve a great
                problem that leads to many other problems requires very creative thinking and innovative ideas.</p>
            <p>Finally, decide what course of action - making decisions is an important skill. (About this subpage to
                earn)</p>
            <h3>5. Implementation</h3>
            <b>This stage involves adopting and carrying out the chosen course of action</b>
            <p>Implementation means acting on the chosen solution. During implementation, more problems may arise,
                especially if the identification or structure of the original problem has not been fully carried
                out.</p>
            <h3>6. Monitoring / seeking opinions</h3>
            <b>The last stage concerns the review of the results of solving problems in a given period, including
                obtaining feedback on the success of the results of the chosen solution</b>
            <p>The final troubleshooting step is to check if the process was successful. This can be achieved by
                monitoring and receiving feedback from people affected by any changes. It is good practice to record the
                results and any additional problems that arise.</p>
